# gif-randomizer
:hammer: This is a single html file that runs a Vue.js instance, it takes the text from the input and starts querying Gifs from one of two popular gif APIs. Then after 3 gifs are loaded into the queue, it starts displaying gifs until you reload or restart the gif queue by changing a parameter and pressing enter or pressing the reload gif button!
